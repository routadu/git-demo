La-la, la-la, la

Yeah, it's been a long night and the mirror's telling me to go home (Home)
But it's been a long time since I felt this good on my own
Lotta years went by with my hands tied up in your ropes
Forever, and ever, no more (No more)

The midnight sky's, the road I'm taking
Head high up in the clouds (Oh-whoa)

I was born to run, I don't belong to anyone, oh, no
I don't need to be loved by you (By you)
Fire in my lungs, can't bite the devil on my tongue, oh, no
I don't need to be loved by you
See my lips, on her mouth, everybody's talking now, baby
Ooh, you know it's true, yeah
That I was born to run, I don't belong to anyone, oh, no
I don't need to be loved by you (Loved by you)

La-la, la-la, la

She got her hair pulled back 'cause the sweat's dripping off of her face (Her face)
Said it ain't so bad if I wanna make a couple mistakes
You should know right now that I never stay put in one place
Forever and ever, no more (No more)

The midnight sky's, the road I'm taking
Head high up in the clouds (Oh-whoa)

I was born to run, I don't belong to anyone, oh, no
I don't need to be loved by you (By you)
Fire in my lungs, can't bite the devil on my tongue, oh, no
I don't need to be loved by you
See my lips, on her mouth, everybody's talking now, baby
Ooh, you know it's true, yeah
That I was born to run, I don't belong to anyone, oh, no
I don't need to be loved by you (By you)

Oh

I don't hide, blurry eyes like you
Like you

I was born to run, I don't belong to anyone, oh, no
I don't need to be loved by you (By you)
Fire in my lungs, can't bite the devil on my tongue, you know
I don't need to be loved by you
See his hands 'round my waist, thought you never be replaced, baby
Ooh, you know it's true, yeah
That I was born to run, I don't belong to anyone, oh, no
I don't need to be loved by you
Yea

La-la, la-la, la
La-la

You know it's true
You know it's true
(Loved by you)
